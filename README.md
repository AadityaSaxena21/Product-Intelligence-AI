# Product Intelligence AI 📋⚡

An autonomous customer telemetry and market diagnostics engine. This platform scrapes unstructured discussions across public web nodes (YouTube comments, HackerNews threads, forums), classifies customer sentiment with transformer-based NLP, isolates product failure vectors, and compiles actionable executive briefings using high-throughput open-weights LLMs.

Designed for product teams, strategy leads, and founders who need real customer signal without marketing noise.

## ✨ **Key Features**

* **Transformer-Grade Sentiment Classification:** Evaluates public reviews using RoBERTa fine-tuned on social context, categorizing signal into positive, neutral, and negative metrics.
* **Substantive Feature Extraction:** Identifies concrete product attributes, thermal states, workflow bottlenecks, and pricing grievances using n-gram frequency rather than broad labels.
* **Anti-Meta Strategic Synthesis:** Enforces strict prompt boundaries on Groq LLM inference to ensure turnaround advice addresses the product itself (engineering, onboarding, positioning, and roadmap moats)—excluding internal pipeline noise.
* **Editorial Binder Interface:** A distraction-free UI featuring smooth tab navigation (`#tab-overview`, `#tab-voice`, `#tab-findings`, `#tab-actions`) and clear data hierarchy.
* **Automated PDF Audit Generation:** Compiles an executive-ready, multi-page briefing document on the fly using ReportLab with custom typography and clean pagination.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**
* Python 3.10+
* A Groq Cloud API Key ([Get one here](https://console.groq.com))
* YouTube Data API v3 Key (via Google Cloud Console)

---

### **2. Installation**

Clone the repository and set up your virtual environment:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/AadityaSaxena21/Product-Intelligence-AI.git](https://github.com/AadityaSaxena21/Product-Intelligence-AI.git)
cd Product-Intelligence-AI

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If you do not have a `requirements.txt` file yet, run `pip install streamlit plotly reportlab python-dotenv groq pandas torch transformers scikit-learn google-api-python-client` and generate it with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

---

### **3. Environment Configuration**

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
```

---

### **4. Running the Application**

Launch the Streamlit executive briefing console:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py
```

Enter any target product (e.g., `iPhone 15`, `Linear`, `Notion`) and click **Run audit**.

## 📄 **Output Artifacts**

Running an audit generates two persisted assets for each analyzed entity:

* `data/<product>_analysis.json`: Raw telemetry, sentiment distribution, and structured JSON LLM dossier.
* `reports/<product>_product_report.txt`: Formatted plain-text intelligence dossier.
* **Downloadable Executive Briefing (PDF):** High-fidelity executive memo generated directly from the dashboard.

---

## 🛡 **Security & Privacy**

* Sensitive credentials (`.env`) and local cache folders are ignored by Git.
* Pipeline execution strips external platform metadata to focus reports strictly on product engineering, positioning, and user experience.
